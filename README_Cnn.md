## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
- A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- The results indicate that the class rebalance has helped to improve the results.
- After class rebalance, the model is more accurate.
- The model is not overfitting or underfitting the data.


## Technologies Used
- python - version 3.8
- tensorflow - version 2.8.0
- pandas
- numpy

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by Upgrad & IIITB AI/ ML course module on CNN.
